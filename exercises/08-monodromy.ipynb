    "# The monodromy method\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to using the `solve` function is solving a polynomial system $F=(f_1,\\ldots,f_n)$ by monodromy. This approach is more efficient, but requires the user to provide at least one solution of $F=0$. Here is the basic idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $x$ is a solution $F(x)=0$ and that $F(x)=F(x,u)$ is a point in a family of polynomial systems \n",

    "$$P=\\{F(x,u) \\mid u\\in \\mathbb{C}^k\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The monodromy method consists in moving around $u$ in a loop starting and ending at $u_0$ while tracking $x$ along that loop. After one iteration usually one has found a new solution $y\\in \\mathbb{C}^n$. This process then is repeated until some stopping criterion is fulfilled.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the initial parameters $u_0=(1,1)$ we have the solution $(x,y) = (1,1)$. For finding all solutions of $F_2$ we use"
