    "## What is a good choice for ${\\cal F}_Q$?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are infinitely many choices for the family ${\\cal F}_Q$. A reasonable choice of ${\\cal F}_Q$ should satisfy at least the following two criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We are able to solve $F_q(x) = 0$ for some $q \\in Q \\setminus \\Sigma$, and *this should be easier than solving $F_p(x) = 0$*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* We would like $F = F_p \\in {\\cal F}_Q$ such that ${\\cal N}(p,Q) \\approx {\\cal N}(Q)$. Preferably, we would like $p \\in Q \\setminus \\Sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveat: unlike in the offline-online approach, we're assuming here that we only want to solve one particular system of equations $F(x) = 0$. In case we want to solve many systems from the same family ${\\cal F}_Q$, it is reasonable to spend more effort on the offline computation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some simple examples: \n",

    "* Why not choose ${\\cal F}_Q = \\{ F \\}, Q = \\{\\text{pt} \\}$? \n",
